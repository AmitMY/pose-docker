# Pose-Docker

This repository will hopefully be the home for all pose estimation models, in docker containers.

We currently support [Convolutional Pose Machines](https://github.com/timctho/convolutional-pose-machines-tensorflow) (CPM) and [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose).

## Requirements
Your Nvidia drivers should be able to support CUDA 10. 


## Usage
README files are supplied in each directory (CPM/OpenPose/Google) on how to build and run each image.
